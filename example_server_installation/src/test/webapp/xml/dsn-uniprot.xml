    <DESCRIPTION>UniProt Archive (UniParc) is part of UniProt project. It is a non-redundant archive of protein sequences extracted from public databases UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, PIR-PSD, EMBL, EMBL WGS, Ensembl, IPI, PDB, PIR-PSD, RefSeq, FlyBase, WormBase, H-Invitational Database, TROME database, European Patent Office proteins, United States Patent and Trademark Office proteins (USPTO) and Japan Patent Office proteins.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>IPI provides a top level guide to the main databases that describe the proteomes of higher eukaryotic organisms. IPI: 1. effectively maintains a database of cross references between the primary data sources  2. provides minimally redundant yet maximally complete sets of proteins for featured species (one sequence per transcript)  3. maintains stable identifiers (with incremental versioning) to allow the tracking of sequences in IPI between IPI releases.  IPI is updated monthly in accordance with the latest data released by the primary data sources.</DESCRIPTION>
