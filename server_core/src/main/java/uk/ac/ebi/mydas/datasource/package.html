    This package contains the interfaces and utility classes that you should use to build
    your own datasource plugin.
</p>
<p>
    As far as possible, this API has been designed to make it possible to create plugins to
    any data source without making any assumptions about the API that you wish to use to
    achieve this, apart from the very simple, DAS oriented API provided here.
</p>
<h2>
    Getting Started with your Implementation
</h2>
<p>
    First of all, it is highly recommended that you become familiar with the
    <a href="http://biodas.org/documents/spec.html">
         Distributed Sequence Annotation System (DAS) 1.53
    </a>
    specification document.  This is a complete and concise description of the
    DAS protocol which is implemented in this API.
</p>
<p>
    Two kinds of DAS server are specified:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#annotationServer">Annotation Servers</a> provide feature information
        for the segments / entry points that they cover.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#referenceServer">Reference Servers</a> extend annotation servers
        and are able to return both the sequence of the segment and, in the case
        of nucleic acid DAS servers, the hierarchical structure of the assembly.
    </li>
</ul>
<a name="annotationServer"/>
<h2>
    Implementing an Annotation Server
</h2>
<p>
    If you are implementing an annotation server, you should implement the
    {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.AnnotationDataSource} interface.
</p>
<p>
    By default, the MydasServlet will handle requests for features within a range on
    the requested segment (e.g. if the DAS client requests only features between residues 200
    and 400, it will automatically filter the features that your plugin returns to include only
    the correct features).
</p>
<p>
    It is possible however, that this mechanism may be inneficient for your data source, especially
    if you have a large number of very massive segments with a lot of annotation.  In this case,
    you <b>may</b> additionally implement the {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.RangeHandlingAnnotationDataSource} interface
    which will allow you to take control of the filtering of features by coordinate at the query level.
</p>
<a name="referenceServer"/>
<h2>
    Implementing a Reference Server
</h2>
<p>
    If you are implementing a reference server, you should implement the
    {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.ReferenceDataSource} interface.
</p>
<p>
    By default, the MydasServlet will handle requests for both sequence and features within a range on
    the requested segment (e.g. if the DAS client requests only features or sequence between residues 200
    and 400, it will automatically filter the features / sequence that your plugin returns to include only
    the correct features or sequence).
</p>
<p>
    It is possible however, that this mechanism may be inneficient for your data source, especially
    if you have a large number of very massive segments with a lot of annotation.  In this case,
    you <b>may</b> additionally implement the {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.RangeHandlingAnnotationDataSource} and / or
    the {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.RangeHandlingReferenceDataSource} interfaces
    which will allow you to take control of filtering at the query level.
</p>
<p>
    The {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.RangeHandlingAnnotationDataSource}
    interface will allow you to filter features
    by their coordinates and the
    {@link uk.ac.ebi.mydas.datasource.RangeHandlingReferenceDataSource} interface
    will allow you to filter sequence by coordinates.  <i>You can implement one or both of
    these interfaces as is most appropriate for your reference data source.</i>
</p>
